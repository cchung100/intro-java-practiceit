~ File Purpose: MuchBetter.java is a solution for BJP5 Exercise 1.5: MuchBetter. The prompt is below.
Write a complete Java program in a class named MuchBetter that prints the following output:
A "quoted" String is
'much' better if you learn
the rules of "escape sequences."
Also, "" represents an empty String.
Don't forget: use \" instead of " !
'' is not the same as "
~ Break the problem into objectives:
OBJ1. Create a class named MuchBetter.
OBJ2. Create a main method.
OBJ3. Print the message in the main method.
*/

public class MuchBetter {   // OBJ1
    public static void main(String[] args) {  // OBJ2
        // OBJ3 is the println statement below
        System.out.println("A \"quoted\" String is\n'much' better if you learn\nthe rules of \"escape sequences.\"\nAlso, \"\" represents an empty String.\nDon't forget: use \\\" instead of \" !\n'' is not the same as \"");
       // To show more examples of escape sequences, I wrote a single statement with multiple \n (new line) instead of a series of printlns.
    }
}
